# bright - a Gentoo overlay

This is my overlay, with random stuffs from the Internet.
Oftentimes it's just because I can't wait for a newer version of a package,
or because I want to help a stranger on the Internet :)

## How to use

With `eselect-repository`:

```
# eselect repository enable bright
```

With `layman`:

```
# layman -a bright
```
